      <div class="list panel-body"> This project is part of a master's degree in "Data Journalism" at Boise State University. I'm building an alternative legislative portal for the state of Idaho that:
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Uses data from the Sunlight Foundation Open States Project API to provide a rich dataset of state legislative data</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Provides social tools to bills and other legislative action, allowing constituents to "testify" on bills online</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Provides some basic statistics on legislative actions</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Provides a means to parse votes in various ways - by bill, lawmaker, party, etc.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Demonstrates the type of information that hacker-journalists can access</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Demonstrates the cross-over between "open government" and "open news" initiatives</li>
</ul>
