<h1>Interactive Portal to Idaho Legislature - Under Construction</h1>

This project is part of a master's degree in "Data Journalism" at Boise State University. I'm building an alternative legislative portal for the state of Idaho that:
<ul>
<li>Uses data from the Sunlight Foundation Open States Project API to provide a rich dataset of state legislative data</li>
<li>Provides social tools to bills and other legislative action, allowing constituents to "testify" on bills online</li>
<li>Provides some basic statistics on legislative actions</li>
<li>Provides a means to parse votes in various ways - by bill, lawmaker, party, etc.</li>
<li>Demonstrates the type of information that hacker-journalists can access</li>
<li>Demonstrates the cross-over between "open government" and "open news" initiatives</li>
</ul>
</div>
