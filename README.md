# Interactive Portal to Idaho Legislature - Under Construction

This project is part of a master's degree in "Data Journalism" at Boise State University. I'm building an alternative legislative portal for the state of Idaho that: 

- Uses data from the Sunlight Foundation [Open States Project API] (https://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/) to provide a rich dataset of state legislative data
- Provides social tools to bills and other legislative action, allowing constituents to "testify" on bills online
- Provides some basic statistics on legislative actions
- Provides a means to parse votes in various ways - by bill, lawmaker, party, etc.
- Demonstrates the type of information that hacker-journalists can access
- Demonstrates the cross-over between "open government" and "open news" initiatives

- In this idleg_flask repo, I'm refactoring and building out the project with Python Flask
